# Memory Game Project

This is my memory game created in Q3 of 2019 as part of the Udacity Nano Degree curriculum for a front-end developer.

The HTML and CSS were primarily provided by Udacity with the exception of some minor modifications to classes and the CSS that handled them.

Finally, the game runs with Javascript in app.js and has been commented for ease of understanding.

# How to play

User should click on any 2 tiles. Upon matching, they will change colors and stay flipped over. The goal of the game is to match all 16 tiles from memory.

You will receive a finl time and a star rating based on the # of moves you make during the game. Whe you win, you'll be notified and your performance stats will be presented.
